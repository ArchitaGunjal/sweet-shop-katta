# Database (SQLite files should generally not be committed, but for this specific Kata submission, 
# you might want to keep the schema.prisma. DO NOT commit the binary .db file usually, 
# but if you want the reviewer to see data immediately, you *can* commit it. 
# Standard practice is to ignore it, so we will ignore it here.)
